# RemoteClaw 🦀

> Your `~/.<agent>` — remotely.

Your local agent setup — skills, memory, configuration — over WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, and 18 more channels. Nothing reimplemented. The SDKs do the work.

Fork of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). Different engine, same channels.
