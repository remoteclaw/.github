# RemoteClaw 🦀

**Universal AI agent middleware.** Run Claude, Codex, or Gemini remotely via WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Signal, iMessage — with your full `~/.claude` configuration.

Fork of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). Different engine, same channels. No reimplemented agentic loop — just the official SDKs, 22 channel adapters, and nothing in between.

The crab way.
